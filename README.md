 A blue screen of death is known as a "Stop Error" or "Severe Stop Error" in the Windows XP manuals. A blue screen of "real" death happens when the core of the operating system can not recover from an error and the only action a user can take is to reboot the system, losing all the unsaved work, the status of all the programs running on At this point, 1 endangering the integrity of the file system and the files themselves created by Windows, at this point it is possible to lose all information on hard drives managed by Windows and its NTFS or FAT 16/32 file system. The information shown on the blue screen of death is not, in any case, sufficient to determine the error. The screen only shows the point at which the code failed, which in most cases can be completely different from the point where the error originated, causing the detection of the error to be very difficult, if not impossible.

Blue screens have also been seen in embedded systems running Microsoft Windows. Common examples are telephone booths for Internet access, information screens, some arcade machines where the board is a PC and even ATMs.
